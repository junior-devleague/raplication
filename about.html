					When visiting this site, one may ask: "Why does a site called Rapplication not incorporate any rap"? This is the 100% truth. However, qualities needed for rap include public speaking and advanced composition. Our goal is to teach viewers how to improve their public speaking skills and give various tips on how to incorporate literary devices and/or rhyme in a writing piece.

					You can use the speech tool to record youself and watch torself talk so you see what you can improve on.  It also can give you a score on your speech to see what you did good.
