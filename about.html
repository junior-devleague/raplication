					When visiting this site, one may ask: "Why does a site called Raplication not incorporate any rap"? This is the 100% truth. However, qualities needed for rap include public speaking and advanced composition. Our goal is to teach viewers how to improve their public speaking skills and give various tips on how to incorporate literary devices and/or rhyme in a writing piece.
