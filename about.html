					When visiting this site, one may ask: "Why does a site called Rapplication not incorporate any rap"? This is the 100% truth. However, qualities needed for rap include public speaking and advanced composition. Our goal is to teach viewers how to improve their public speaking skills and give various tips on how to incorporate literary devices and/or rhyme in a writing piece.
					</p>
					<p>
					<h4>Speech</h4>
					You can use the speech tool to record and watch yourself speak. You will receive a score based on how fluent and well-paced your speaking was. You will be able to view your WPM (words per minute).
					</p>
					<p>
					<h4>Composition Tools</h4>
					The tips and advice provided in the "Composition" section are useful if one wants to understand how to use certain literary devices, especially in poetry. Additional tips for how to write more sophisticated rhymes are also provided.
