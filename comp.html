					<h3>
					  	Composition Tools:
					</h3>
						<p>
							Rapping requires superb public speaking skills and rhythm. However, one must also be able to compose sophisticated lyrics that also possibly have multiple different meanings. Here is an example:
						</p>
						<p>
							"They tell me try to be the greatest, but I shoot them a frown,
							cause they tell me to reach the apex, but it's too far down" 
						</p>
						<p>
							At first, the line seems primitive and simple in that it rhymes one syllable words with each other (frown and down). However, under further investigation, the words "greatest" and "apex" are considered near rhymes. On a deeper level, it can be reasonably inferred that the writer means to say that he is upset when people tell him to try to achieve greatness since he already has achieved it, and they tell him to try to shoot for the top but it is already below him. These are examples of the literary device "irony".
						</p>
					<h4>
						The Simile:
					</h4>
						<p>
							Similes use the words "like" or "as" to compare. They are commonly used in poetry/music. Here is an example:
						</p>
						<p>
						I want to make my life work so, I'm lookin' for answers,
						</p>
						<p>
						Still goin' round in circles like a ballroom dancer. 
						</p>
						<p>
						This line compares life to a ballroom dancer, in that he is trying to figure his life out but he is continuously going around in an endless loops. The simile greatly improves the impact of the two lines as it gives the reader something they can picture in their brain.
