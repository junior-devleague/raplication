						<p>
							Rapping requires superb public speaking skills and rhythm. However, one must also be able to compose sophisticated lyrics that also possibly have multiple different meanings. Here is an example:
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							"They tell me try to be the greatest, but I shoot them a frown,
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							cause they tell me to reach the apex, but it's too far down" 
						</p>
						<p>
							At first, the line seems primitive and simple in that it rhymes one syllable words with each other (frown and down). However, under further investigation, the words "greatest" and "apex" are considered near rhymes. On a deeper level, it can be reasonably inferred that the writer means to say that he is upset when people tell him to try to achieve greatness since he already has achieved it, and they tell him to try to shoot for the top but it is already below him. These are examples of the literary device "irony".
						</p>
					<h4 class="bold">
						The Simile:
					</h4>
						<p>
							Similes use the words "like" or "as" to compare. They are commonly used in poetry/music. Here is an example:
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							"I want to make my life work so, I'm lookin' for answers,
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							still goin' round in circles like a ballroom dancer" 
						</p>
						<p>
							This line compares life to a ballroom dancer, in that he is trying to figure his life out but he is continuously going around in an endless loop. The simile greatly improves the impact of the two lines as it gives the reader something they can picture in their brain.
						</p>
					<h4 class="bold">
						The Metaphor:
					</h4>
						<p>
							Metaphors are commonly found in poetry, but their power in a rap song is underestimated. Here is an example:
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							"Take it, patience, one day you'll be the greatest,
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							in darkness you'll be bright so people call you an oasis"
						</p>
						<p>
							The "oasis" metaphor adds sensory details to the piece that greatly improve the power of the two lines. Comparing a real life quality to a feeling or object can have a profound impact on a piece.
						</p>
					<h4 class="bold">
						Complex Rhymes:
					</h4>
						<p>
							Compared to other poetry genres, rap lyrics typically contain more rhymes. However, complex and more sophisticated rhymes significantly enhance a piece, regardless of the genre. It may be hard to put together a string of multisyllabic rhymes, but take into account that "slant rhymes" can be equally effective (i.e. "confidence and prominent"). Internal rhymes (rhymes in the middle of a line) can also be effective. Here is an example of a mixture of multisyllabic rhymes, slant rhymes, and internal rhymes:
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							"Answer me if with no confidence, you think you could be prominent,
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							and receive all these compliments, and achieve those accomplishments"
						</p>
						<p>
							Each rhyme has 2-4 syllables. There are numerous slant rhymes (confident, prominent, compliment, acccomplishment), and also internal rhymes (receive, achieve). 
						</p>
					<h4 class="bold">
						Final Word and Links:
					</h4>
						<p>
							These are only three types of literary devices used in rap music. They can also be effective in compositions across a broad range of topics. There are numerous explanations of multiple literary devices, and if additional explanations are needed the links below may also be useful. We hope you understand more about the sophistication of rap music!
